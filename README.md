String Manipulation Toolbox ðŸ§©

This project was developed during my private programming lessons at Computer Science Center (csc.gr).
It is a JavaScript console application that performs multiple string transformations and analyses, providing hands-on experience with string manipulation, ASCII values, and algorithmic thinking.

Features âœ¨

The program allows the user to input a string (6â€“12 characters) and then applies various operations, including:

Reversed String: Outputs the string in reverse order

Even-Odd Uppercase: Converts characters at even positions to uppercase

ASCII Transformation: Replaces characters at even positions with their ASCII codes

Decreasing Order ASCII: Sorts characters based on their ASCII values

Next Letter: Shifts each letter to the next one in the alphabet

String to Letter Position: Converts letters to their corresponding position in the alphabet

Consonant to Vowel Separation: Separates vowels and consonants

What I Learned ðŸ“š

Through this project, I improved my skills in:

Handling user input and validating string constraints in Node.js

Using loops, nested loops, and conditional logic to manipulate strings

Applying ASCII codes and understanding their role in programming

Implementing different algorithmic approaches to string processing

Strengthening problem-solving and computational thinking with practical exercises

This project was an excellent way to solidify my JavaScript fundamentals and gain confidence in data transformation and string operations.
